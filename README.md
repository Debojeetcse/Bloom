# Bloom
Bloom is a minimal Git-like implementation in Ruby, reimagining core Git internals (objects, trees, commits, refs) with educational clarity. It is not intended for production use — it’s a learning tool and foundation for prototyping.

To try the CLI (stub):

	ruby .\bin\bloom

On Windows (PowerShell), if Ruby is installed and on PATH:

	ruby .\bin\bloom init

If Ruby is not available, install Ruby for Windows or run via WSL/WSL2.
